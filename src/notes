TODO- levarer
1) why:
void foo()
{
not legal?

2) implementation of an identifying method for everything- method, each type, blocks

3) implementation of a data structure that contains everything that can exist once (variables, variable names)
4) different dict for global var. and another for local
5) in s-java, what is the difference between declaring a local vs. global variable inside the same method?
    especially variables with the same name.
6) everytime a method is recognized, initialize a method's variables dictionary
-make array of final variables
-recursive method for indentifying scopes inside methods
-legallity of local variable (5.2.2, never used or assigned in the next appearance)
-notice types hirarchy
-5.2.3 assigning global values in a wierd way
-array of methods
-local method- possible in s-java?
-legality check of boolean variable
-legality of lines in a scope, and use it in the validity of method's body
-comments with a whitespace before it is illegal
