//TODO IMPORTANT!
// In a case of an un-initialized global variable (meaning it is not assigned a value anywhere
//outside a method), all methods may refer to it (regardless of their location in relation to its
//declaration), but every method using it (in an assignment, as an argument to a method call)
//must first assign a value to the global variable itself (even if it was assigned a value in some
//other method).


  //todo is 093 valid? (in doubleVariable & boolean)
   //todo should include "" ? (in charVariable)
